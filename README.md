## Getting Started 
### Dependencies Prerequisites
**Make sure you have Node version >= 5.11 and NPM >= 3**
> If you have `nvm` installed, which is highly recommended (`brew install nvm`) you can do a `nvm install --lts && nvm use` in `$` to run with the latest Node LTS. You can also have this `zsh` done for you [automatically](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#calling-nvm-use-automatically-in-a-directory-with-a-nvmrc-file).

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:

* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `typings` (`npm install --global typings`)

### Running Development
Once you have installed all prerequisites,

* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `nvm use` use the node version from .nvmrc
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `npm start` to run our demo app locally

> If you are having issues setting up your local development, try `rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clean`, and re-run `npm install`. If issues still persist, please file an [issue](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/BLiC-Java-UI/issues).
